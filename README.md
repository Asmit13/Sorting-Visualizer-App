# Sorting Visualizer App

The Sorting Visualizer App is an interactive web application designed to help users understand and visualize various sorting algorithms.  
By providing a graphical representation of sorting processes, the app makes it easier to grasp how different algorithms operate and compare their efficiencies.

## Live Demo

Experience the application firsthand by visiting the live demo: [Sorting Visualizer App](https://sorting-visualizer-app-lemon.vercel.app/)

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Visualize popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
- **Customizable Array Size and Speed:** Adjust the size of the array and the speed of the visualization to suit your learning pace.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization:** Observe each step of the sorting process to understand the inner workings of the algorithms.
- **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless experience across various devices, thanks to the app's responsive design.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The app is built using [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html), providing a robust foundation for developing scalable web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Styling is managed with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), enabling a utility-first approach to design.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asmit13/Sorting-Visualizer-App.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd Sorting-Visualizer-App
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.  
The page will reload when you make changes, and you may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **`npm start`**  
  Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

- **`npm test`**  
  Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

- **`npm run build`**  
  Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
  The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed! See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
